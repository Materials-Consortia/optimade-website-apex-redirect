# optimade-website-apex-redirect
The only purpose of this repository is to create an "empty" website to serve on our apex domain, which redirects the visitor to www.optimade.org

This provides a fix for the present inability of github pages to correctly serve ssl cetificates for both https://www.optimade.org and https://optimade.org  

For more information about this issue, see the discussion here: https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1675
